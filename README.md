This is a Google Chrome extension in which you can specify a list of browser tabs and then open a new browser window
with these tabs. You can also choose whether a tab will be pinned or not. This extension is handy when you have
your favorite list of tabs that you like having always open and you don't want to open them manually every time you
restart your browser.
